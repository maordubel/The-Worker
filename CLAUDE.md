# The Worker — working notes for Claude

Hebrew, RTL, single-club (Hapoel Tel Aviv) football history game.
Read `docs/00-architecture.md` before changing anything structural.

## Rules specific to this repo

1. **One shared data engine.** Game modes are read-models over the canonical tables.
   Never create a mode-specific dataset.
2. **Every fact carries `source_id` + `confidence`.** Only `confidence >= 2` may feed
   the trivia generator.
3. **`match_event` is append-only.** Corrections insert a row with `voids_event_id`.
   Read `v_match_event_effective`, never the raw table.
4. **Answers never reach the client.** `trivia_answer` has RLS with no read policy.
   Grading happens in `rpc_submit_answer` (`SECURITY DEFINER`, idempotency key).
5. **`media.usable_in_app` stays false** until rights are settled. The DB enforces it.
6. **Only `(כדורגל)` content.** The source wiki also covers basketball — filter and
   assert it in every ingest report.
7. **Hebrew names are matched through `entity_alias`, never fuzzily.**
8. **Design tokens only.** Territory and tokens: `docs/01-brand-concept.md`.
   No raw hex, no ad-hoc px, no shadows, radius 0.
9. **RTL-first.** Logical properties. Wrap mixed-direction runs in `<bdi>`.
10. **No user-facing string in code.** Everything through `messages/he.json` + `t()`.

11. **The ingestion layer never invents.** Unreadable field → null. Unusable row →
    reported as skipped/rejected with a reason. Blocked source → documented, not
    substituted. See `docs/03-ingestion.md`.
12. **One file knows MediaWiki:** `scripts/ingest/adapters/mediawiki.ts`. A provider
    field name anywhere else is a defect.
13. **A derby means Maccabi Tel Aviv. Nothing else.** It is a `club.is_derby_rival` flag
    and a DB trigger that derives `match.is_derby`. Never hand-set it, never widen it.
14. **Football and basketball never mix.** Every sport-bearing table carries `sport`,
    a trigger rejects a cross-sport match, and aliases are scoped by sport. The Hapoel
    Ussishkin chapter is basketball.
15. **Always expand the research.** Project rule from Maor: never stop at the first
    answer — bring sources and additional information. Verdicts and sources for the
    current data live in `docs/04-verified-research.md`.
16. **Maor Harel, founder of Hapoel Ussishkin, appears only where a source names him.**
    At most one such question per session, never as a distractor, never in football
    records. His role is stored as `association_role` rows with sources, like anyone
    else's. Do not distort history to personalise it — the Ussishkin story does not
    need help.
